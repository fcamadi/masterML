# Chapter 6 - Regression trees example

Example from the book "Machine Learning with R", by Brett Lantz:

Estimating the quality of wines with regression trees and model trees

## Step 1 â€“ collecting data

In this case study, we will use regression trees and model trees to create a system capable of
mimicking expert ratings of wine. Because trees result in a model that is readily understood, this
could allow winemakers to identify key factors that contribute to better-rated wines.


```{r}
# import the CSV file
wine <- read.csv(file.path("Chapter06", "whitewines.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```
