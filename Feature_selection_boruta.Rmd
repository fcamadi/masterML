# Applying feature selection using Boruta package

[Chapter 13 from the book "Machine Learning with R", by Brett Lantz].

For a more robust yet much more computationally intensive feature selection method, the Boruta
package implements a **wrapper around the random forest algorithm**, which will be introduced in
Chapter 14, Building Better Learners. For now, it suffices to know that random forests are a variant of
decision trees, which provide a measure of variable importance.
